Android motion simulator with sensor support.


## Scenarios

If you study in universities in China, there'll be
no necessity to explain it.

Despite how hard the faculty tries to make us take an
after-dinner sunny long run every three days,
we always want to create something innovative to make the life a little
bit easier.

## Usage

* Pick up your phone and turn on the motion recorder
* Take a one-hundred-meter speed run and press `STOP`
* Draw the path you desire to be running on
* Set velocity and repeat count
* Make more time

### Adding salt
Now for each emulation, the path to run on
is exactly the same

To reverse the behavior to make it not so sus

* Turn to the `Manage` page and navigate to the trace
* `Add` some `Random Factor`, saying `x`
* Add some salt, like `Rotation`
* Expand the salt you've just added, and put in some
  mathematics expression involving `x` as you like

Note: knowledge of linear algebra may be needed

### For users whose targeting location is in China mainland

Due to mapping restrictions, ensure that **coordinate system**
of the pending trace in Manage -> Trace page is set to **GCJ02**

## Build Instructions

Build and maintain this project with Android Studio
or Intellij IDEA.

This app contains sdk from Amap and Google Maps, thus **api keys** are
required.
Obtain them from [here](https://console.amap.com/dev/key/app)
[and here](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-sdk/start)
```shell
echo amap.web.key="<Your Key>" >> local.properties
echo AMAP_SDK_KEY="<Your Key>" >> local.properties
echo GCP_MAPS_KEY="<Your Key>" >> local.properties
```
